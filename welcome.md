# Women in Technology

Welcome to the public landing page for the <a href="">Women in Technology Slack group</a>. Our group is a <strong>safe, confidential space for women who work in technology</strong> to chat and support each other. Please consider joining us whether you are new to the tech industry or you are a long-time practitioner. 

<strong>Not a programmer? That's fine!</strong> Our group does not exclude people who work in technical writing, software testing and QA, graphic design, user experience, project management, customer support, or other areas that are sometimes invisible in the discourse on women in tech.
