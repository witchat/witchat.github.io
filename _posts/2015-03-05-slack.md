Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called “channels”, and we have several set up. There are three you’ll be in by default:

- <strong>#admin-announcements</strong>: occasional announcements and messages about group governance
- <strong>#introductions</strong>: a space for new members to tell the community a bit about themselves 
- <strong>#-channel-guide</strong>: help navigating our 500+ channels

All rooms are opt-in except <strong>#admin-announcements</strong>; posting in there is limited to admins.
